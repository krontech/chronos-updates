 - Focus peaking color resets after rebooting camera, or pressing OK on Record Settings.
 - Segmented record mode only: Invalid data would sometimes appear at the end of the recording.
 - Gated burst record mode only: recordings would be corrupted and/or incorrect length.
 - White balance doesn't work so well when framerate and gain are high

 - Focus peaking color would get reset after reboot or changing resolution
 - "Restore Settings from backup" not working
 - Prerecord box not showing on Record Modes if gated burst is enabled before that screen was opened.
 - Minor UI issues

Compatibility Issues:
 - The pixel packing order in Raw 12-bit mode has been changed for the v0.3.1 release.
   Given a pair of two 12-bit pixels in hexidecmal as (0x123, 0xabc), the bytes produced
   by the Raw 12-bit packing mode changes as follows:
     v0.3.0 and earlier: (0xab, 0xc1, 0x23)
     v0.3.1 and later: (0x23, 0x1c, 0xab)

Known Bugs:
 - The first frame of an H.264 recording is erroneously copied from the display buffer before the recording starts.
 - After saving hundreds or thousands (usually thousands) of videos, the camera may lock up on the playback/save window.
 - After rebooting a camera, focus aid and zebras are sometimes not restored even if they were enabled before the reboot.
 - Gated Burst record mode only: Live display does not appear to be buffered correctly when the trigger signal is inactive.
 - Gated burst record mode only: Trigger stops responding after multiple triggers until the recording is stopped and restarted.

    +----------------------------------+

Features added and bugs fixed since 0.2:

Notable Changes:
- White balance can be selected from 5 common presets in addition to taking your own as you could previously.
- Custom White Balance calibration (via Set White Balance) now works as expected, and produces vastly more realistic colours.
- Colour reproduction is greatly improved, especially reds.
- Set White Balance now calculates against 80% brightness white instead of 100% brightness white.
- File size warning when saving are generally more reliable now. (eg., 4+GB file warning now FAT32-only, since only FAT32 has a 4GB file size limit.)
- Changes to video saving settings are now applied as they are made, not just when the popup is closed.
- Keyboard behavior improved; text is now selected when you tap an edit box.
- UI can be flipped upside-down, or set to display the main screen menu on the left side.
- You can configure the "Unsaved video in RAM" popup that appears when you hit the record button with an unsaved video in memory. It can be set to "Always", "If not reviewed" (default), or "Never". The previous behavior was always "If not reviewed".
- The sliders on main screen the play screen have been made larger for ease of grabbing.
- Trigger I/O's Trigger delay input was moved to the Trigger Delay screen. A slider has been added as a visual aid and an alternate way to adjust the trigger delay. The ratio between post-trigger frames and record length in frames is kept constant between resolution and framerate changes.
- Added Trigger Delay screen and Record Modes screen, accessible from Record Settings. Selectable modes are Normal, Segmented, and Gated Burst.
- Black cal duration reduced by 10s to 15s or so at max resolution.
- Use any SD card. Previously, a class 10 SD card was required. You can now use slower cards. Of course, using a slower SD card means that videos save slower too.
- You can now auto-record after saving and/or auto-save after recording. This can loop if both are used at the same time.

Minutiae:
- Playback screen has 'region to be saved' marked. Each region saved is marked in a different color.
- There is now a Settings tab in the Util pages. This can be used to backup, restore, or reset settings, which does not include black calibration.
- Play -> Settings: bitsPerPixel, maxBitrate, saved file framerate, format, filename and save location are now saved as soon as they are changed instead of when the Close button is pressed.
- Mark In and Mark Out have been renamed to Mark Start and Mark End, probably just until the video seek bar is made horizontal.
- The Enter key has been changed to say Apply, since you have to press it to apply your changes on the record settings window.

Known bugs:
-The first few frames in saved videos are from the end of the recording.
-The camera will freeze after saving approximately 45 videos.  Make sure to reboot before saving approximately 40 videos to ensure the camera does not freeze.
-The camera will freeze when saving a video that is over 4GB onto a FAT32 partition, or when storage is full.
-If auto-record is enabled, but auto-save is not, a new recording will not be started.  However, the camera will still auto-record after booting the camera.
-Warnings about filesize (over fat32 limit, or insufficient free space) can still be shown even if autosave is enabled (if autosave is enabled, the user is unlikely to be there to press Yes for the camera to continue saving)

   ++                                  ++
    +----------------------------------+

 - Extract the `.zip` file into the root directory of a FAT32 formatted USB drive.
    - This should result in a camUpdate folder in the root directory of the stick.
 - Turn on your camera and insert the USB drive into the USB/eSATA combo port.
 - From the main window, tap the `Util` button to open the utility window.
 - As a precaution, tap the `Backup Calibration Data` button on the utility window before starting the update.
    - This should take about 5 seconds. When the backup is completed, a pop-up window will be displayed.
    - Tap the `Done` button to close the pop-up window.
 - From the utility window, tap the `Apply Software Update` button to begin the software update.
    - A warning message will be displayed, tap the `Yes` button to confirm and begin the update.
    - If a pop-up that says 'No software update found' is displayed, even when a USB stick containing the update in the correct location is connected, reboot the camera and try again.
 - During the update, the screen will go blank and an `Applying Update` message may be displayed.
 - After approximately 30 to 60 seconds, the update will be complete and the camera will restart.
